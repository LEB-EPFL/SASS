Installation
++++++++++++

SASS is a `Fiji <http://fiji.sc/>`_ plugin and therefore may be
installed like other plugins.

1. Download the latest .jar file from the `SASS releases page
   <https://github.com/MStefko/SASS/releases>`_.
2. You will also need to download the latest `ALICA_ACPack
   <https://github.com/LEB-EPFL/ALICA_ACPack>`_ .jar, which contains
   the run-time components for control systems simulations.
3. Copy the SASS .jar file into your *~/Fiji.app/plugins/* folder,
   where *Fiji.app* is root directory for your Fiji installation.
4. Copy the ALICA_ACPack .jar file into your *~/Fiji.app/jars* folder.
5. Restart Fiji.

You should now see *SASS* appear as a menu item in the the *Plugins*
menu.
